## Cellular Automata written in Python and inspired by Conway's Game of Life

TODO:
    1. Get player image AND movement synced with the grid (try to resize based on SQUARE_HEIGHT and SQUARE_WIDTH)
        - Likely will need to use transforms https://coderslegacy.com/python/how-to-resize-an-image-in-pygame/
        - May have to switch Pointer back to inheriting from Simulation
    2. Get A/B working to place/remove white squares
    3. Add pause button on Start or Select
    4. Get alternate keyboard controls working if controller is not detected
    5. Test rules and expand on them as needed
